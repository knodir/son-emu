If docker commands or allocation fail keep this fault in mind and try to adjust the amount of available processes and file descriptors.
       EAGAIN A system-imposed limit on the number of threads was
              encountered.  There are a number of limits that may trigger
              this error: the RLIMIT_NPROC soft resource limit (set via
              setrlimit(2)), which limits the number of processes and
              threads for a real user ID, was reached; the kernel's system-
              wide limit on the number of processes and threads,
              /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max, was reached (see proc(5)); or
              the maximum number of PIDs, /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max, was
              reached (see proc(5)).

At the same time, the amount of "docker exec" commands should be limited. Killing certain processes might also help substantially in fixing the problem:
For example:
sudo pkill -f "bash --norc -is mininet
After setting up all the infrastructure and before running benchmarks.
